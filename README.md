<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Sometimes you just feel a little demotivated and need that extra **spark** to get your
day going. Well, I'm here to provide you that SPARK!

This is a simple **Random Quote Generator** that you can use to motivate the hell out of you and all your friends. 

<em>~ Following the guidelines of freeCodeCamps Front End Framework Certificate</em>

### Built With

React, Bootstrap, Axios (API)

The API I used to generate the quotes: https://api.quotable.io

## Reflection

This is a side project build to learn how to use React, hooks, and states. Overall, 
I found React pretty fun to learn, I actually learned about classes and `this.state`
 before learning about hooks. Then I found out the recommended way to make state is 
 using hooks so that kinda sucked...

I find client-side rendering really cool and a lot faster compared to when I was 
making websites using Flask and Python!
